# Exactly what does \`setup all\` install?
Glad you asked! \`setup all\` will go through all of the following steps one by
one. For each step that installs a number of packages/formulas/casks/whatever,
see below for the list of items that will be installed when that step runs.

| Step | Description |
| --- | --- |
$(setup -l | sed 's/^\([^ ]*\) *\(.*\)$/| \1 | \2 |/g')

$(setup -h 2>&1 | grep -A5000 'Homebrew Formulas:')
